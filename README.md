# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown-_Power-BI-Project
This project is based on a guided analysis by AlexTheAnalyst, where I explored survey responses from over 600 data professionals worldwide. The goal was to understand trends in salaries, job difficulty, preferred programming languages, and more â€” using Power BI to deliver clear, actionable insights.
